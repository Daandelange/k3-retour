# Contribute to the Retour plugin

First of all: 🙏 thank you that you want to help! 👏

## Bug reports, feature requests
Please direct all bug reports and requests via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby/issues).

## Translations
Retour could feature translations for all languages that Kirby supports as UI languages in the Panel. A list can be found [here](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/tree/master/i18n/translations) (still a few to go for Retour).

So how can you help? Take a look at the English translation file for reference what language strings are needed:
https://github.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby/blob/master/src/i18n/en.json

You can either head over to [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby) and start translating or fork this repo (develop branch), create a new i18n file for your translation and open a PR. Or you simply post the strings in a new issue here in the repo.
